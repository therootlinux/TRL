# Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation related to our study and development of the Linux kernel, as well as detailed information about the structure of our own kernel project.

To maintain clarity and organization, the documentation is divided into two main subdirectories:

- **Linux/** — Materials, references, and notes pertaining to the original Linux kernel.  
- **TRL/** — Documentation specific to our custom kernel, TheRootLinux (TLR).

This structure facilitates easy navigation between upstream kernel concepts and our own implementation details.
